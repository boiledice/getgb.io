The Go authors agree that vendoring, taking a copy of your dependencies, is the path to repeatable builds -- we just disagree on the method.

The Go authors are recommending vendoring by copying the source of your dependencies into a folder inside your package, then rewriting the source of those vendored depdendencies to accomodate.

gb also recommends vendoring, but with our project based approach we can give the same result -- all dependencies are bundled with the project, without rewriting the source code. We think this is important, and we believe other Go programmers agree.
