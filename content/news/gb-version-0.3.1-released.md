gb version 0.3.1 has been released. This release fixes a bug introduced in 0.3.0 where the name of the package being built was not printed if the compile failed. Depending on how large your gb project was this could be mildly to seriously annoying.

Release notes are [available on Github](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/releases/tag/v0.3.1).
