An update on the changes that have landed in gb in the last month.

<!--more-->

Progress on gb was slow in July due to travel and GopherCon, but things are getting back up to speed. 

Two features have landed in gb vendor which are worth noting.

## gb vendor restore

Adrià Casajús has added a new subcommand to `gb-vendor`, `restore`. 

The intent of the `restore` command is to support project owners who do not want to include a full copy of their dependencies in their project's repository. 

Users of gb projects that use this facility should run `gb vendor restore` each time after updating their working copy. For example

	git pull && gb vendor update

Please try this feature and leave feadback in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues),

Closes issue [#175](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/175).

## gb fetch supports url schemes

`gb vendor fetch` now supports an optional scheme when fetching. For example

    gb vendor fetch https://github.com/pkg/sftp

This may be useful for project owners who need to fetch dependencies from private locations which do not react well to gb's probing to discover the repository scheme. 

This extension is only available on `fetch`, all other commands continue to work on import paths.

See the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/constabulary/gb/cmd/gb-vendor) for full details.
