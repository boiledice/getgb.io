gb version 0.3.2 has been released. This release brings improvements to `gb test`, better handling of ^C during builds, and simplified debugging output.

The logging changes were inspired by [this post about logging](http://dave.cheney.net/2015/11/05/lets-talk-about-logging).

Release notes are [available on Github](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/releases/tag/v0.3.2).
