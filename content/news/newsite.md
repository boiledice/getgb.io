## New Plugins Coming

The [gb community on GitHub](https://github.com/constabulary/gb) are working on new plugins. We've seen proposals for

- [`gb-init`](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/75) - a plugin to create a sample project scaffold, no more `mkdir -p`.
- [`gb-goimports`](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/61) - a plugin that wraps `goimports`.
- [`gb-list`](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/pull/76) - a port of `go list` to help pragmatically interrogate gb projects.

Expect to see those landing soon.
