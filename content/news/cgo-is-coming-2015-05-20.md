## Testers wanted for cgo support

`cgo` support has started to land in gb. At the moment it's quite linux and gcc specific. We welcome enthusiastic testers to take it out for a spin and let us know what does and does not work. 

For progress updates, please follow the [cgo milestone](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/milestones/cgo).
