A quick update on the changes that have landed since the start of June.

## Updated documentation

`cmd/gb` and `cmd/gb-vendor` have updated documentation, unifying the website, godoc and the cli help text. Visit godoc.org, [cmd/gb](http://godoc.org/github.com/constabulary/gb/cmd/gb), [cmd/gb-vendor](http://godoc.org/github.com/constabulary/gb/cmd/gb-vendor), to read the updated documentation.

## gb vendor purge

Thanks to DÃ¡vid Kaya, the `gb vendor` plugin now has a new subcommand, `purge`. `gb vendor purge` will remove any vendored dependency that is not referenced by code in `$PROJECT/src`.

## gb vendor fetch

Support for Mercurial repositories, and import paths with the `bitbucket.org` prefix (git and hg supported) has been added.

## Vanity import paths

`gb vendor fetch` now supports custom remote import paths, otherwise known as [_vanity imports_](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths). This unblocks `gb` users waiting on support for import urls like `golang.org/x` [Fixes 178](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/178)
