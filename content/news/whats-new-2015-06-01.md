A quick update on the new plugins and features that have landed over the previous week.

<!--more-->

## New commands and plugins

- `gb generate` [Fixes #148](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/148), runs `go generate` in the current working directory.

- `gb vendor fetch` now supports `-revision` and `-branch`, thanks to DÃ¡vid Kaya [Fixes #161](https://github.com/constabulary/gb/issues/136)
<pre>% gb vendor fetch -branch master -revision 2788f0dbd16903de03cb8186e5c7d97b69ad387b github.com/kr/fs</pre>
We still only have support for github.com repos, but are working on adding support for vanity imports and the other usual repo locations now.

- `gb doc`, runs `go doc` inside your gb project.

- `gb vendor list`, similar to `gb list`, but gives you access to the contents of the manifest file
<pre>% gb vendor list
github.com/kr/fs        https://github.com/kr/fs        master  2788f0dbd16903de03cb8186e5c7d97b69ad387b</pre>
