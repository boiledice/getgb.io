A picture is worth a thousand words, so let's look at a sample `gb` project.

[The sample repository is here, github.com/constabulary/example-gsftp](https://github.com/constabulary/example-gsftp).

To fetch this project, clone it. You can check out the code anywhere that you like, there is no requirement to check it out inside your <code>$GOPATH</code>.
<pre>% <b>cd $HOME/devel</b>
% <b>git clone https://github.com/constabulary/example-gsftp</b>
Cloning into 'example-gsftp'...</pre>

Let's have a look t the project on disk
<pre>% <b>cd example-gsftp</b>
% <b>tree -d $(pwd)</b>

You can build the project with `gb build`. `gb` prints out each package's name as it compiles it.
<pre>% <b>gb build</b>
github.com/kr/fs
golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/agent
github.com/pkg/sftp
cmd/gsftp</pre>

A this project contains a command package, `cmd/gsftp`, which is built and copied to `$PROJECT/bin/gsftp`.

_note:_ your commands don't need to live in `$PROJECT/src/cmd`, but you cannot place source at the root of `$PROJECT/src` because that [package would not have a name](http://getgb.io/faq/#cannot-build-src-root).

This project uses `gb-vendor` to manage it's dependencies, so let's have a look at what has been vendored.
